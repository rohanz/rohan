## Problem Analysis

There's a complex patent submission process. Patent application processes are traditionally lengthy, repetitive, and user-unfriendly. There's also a lack of transparency. Applicants often have little insight into why their submissions were accepted or rejected.

## Technical Solution

PatentEase was developed as a comprehensive solution, featuring robust technologies and design considerations:

- **Authentication and Storage**: 
  - User authentication handled securely through Supabase Auth.
  - Object storage provided by Supabase for managing uploaded patent documents efficiently and securely.


- **Patent Similarity Checker**: 
  - Utilizes an API to retrieve existing patents from the government database.
  - Patents are then vector-encoded to facilitate similarity comparison.
  - User-submitted patents undergo the same encoding and are compared against the existing database.
  - Generates a similarity score, presenting the most similar patents to the user for easy reference and comparison.

### External API Integration

- Integrates the Intellectual Property Office of Singaporeâ€™s (IPOS) API for reliable retrieval of patent metadata and documents, enhancing accuracy and transparency in data handling.

### Mobile Application Development

- Mobile app developed using **React Native and Expo**, ensuring seamless compatibility across both **iOS** and **Android** platforms.
- Cross-platform development facilitated rapid and consistent user experience, irrespective of device.

### Software Engineering Practices

PatentEase employed robust and modern software engineering methodologies, including:

- **SOLID Principles**:
  - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion principles, significantly enhancing maintainability and scalability.

- **Version Control**:
  - GitHub was utilized for collaborative development, ensuring streamlined tracking of changes and ease of integration.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
  - Pre-defined test cases prior to development, ensuring stable and reliable functionality throughout the development lifecycle.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**:
  - Detailed code comments, updated UML diagrams, and structured documentation practices contributed significantly to long-term project sustainability.
